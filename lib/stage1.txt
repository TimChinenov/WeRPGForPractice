You ever look up at the sky and wonder how there's such a vast amount of empty space out there. It's called a vacuum, odd at first because a normal person has that at home. But this vacuum is intense, like your brains will blow out of your head intense. In any case, space is cool even if it's empty. The same applies with humans...



Some of the most incredible people, have been through or reside in the void of existence. They've become so aware of themselves that they've realized the emptiness of life. It's quite tragic in a sense. But from the void, like that horseman on TV, one gains the knowledge necesary to become, fantastic.(If you thought i was going to say one gains alcoholism, I think you definitely know what show it is.)



I want you to treat your character as he/she/xer IS YOU, roaming through this world, trying to make sense of what has happened. This game is also Rated R btw, so kids, go watch TV or something..


This place is called..Ohjae.
