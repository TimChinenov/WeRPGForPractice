I honestly never heard of spike files before. Apparently these are often used
for code drafts. If you have an idea or small class you want to test or
reference in the future, you place the code here. Its important not to reference
the code in here in other parts of the project. If you want to use code in this
folder eventually, it should be moved or copied into the appropriate folder.
